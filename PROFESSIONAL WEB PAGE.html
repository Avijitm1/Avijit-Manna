Street light controllers are smarter versions of the mechanical or electronic timers previously used for street light ON-OFF operation.

Also many street light controllers come with an astronomical clock for a particular location or a Global Positioning System (GPS) connection to give the best ON-OFF time and energy saving. Automatic Street Light Control System is a simple and powerful concept, which uses transistor as a switch to switch ON and OFF the street light automatically. By using this system manual works are removed. It automatically switches ON lights when the sunlight goes below the visible region of our eyes. It automatically switches OFF lights under illumination by sunlight. This is done by a sensor called Light Dependant Resistor (LDR) which senses the light actually like our eyes By using this system energy consumption is also reduced because now-a-days the manually operated street lights are not switched off properly even the sunlight comes and also not switched on earlier before sunset. In sunny and rainy days, ON time and OFF time differ significantly which is one of the major disadvantage of using timer circuits or manual . This project exploits the working of a transistor in saturation region and cut-off region to switch ON and switch OFF the lights at appropriate time with the help of an electromagnetically operated switch. A street light, lamppost, street lamp, light standard, or lamp standard is a raised source of light on the edge of a road or walkway, which is turned on or lit at a certain time every night. Modern lamps may also have light-sensitive photocells to turn them on at dusk, off at dawn, or activate automatically in dark weather. In older lighting this function would have been performed with the aid of a solar dial. It is not uncommon for street lights to be on poles which have wires strung between them, or mounted on utility poles. This project exploits the working of a transistor in saturation region and cut-off region to switch ON and switch OFF the lights at appropriate time with the help of an electromagnetically operated switch Automatic Streetlight needs no manual operation of switching ON and OFF.

nowadays the manually operated street lights are not switched off even the sunlight comes and also switched on earlier before sunset. In this project, no need of manual operation like ON time and OFF time setting. This project clearly demonstrates the working of transistor in saturation region and cut-off region. </section><article9> <a href="file:///C:/Users/Pc/Desktop/html_css_new/web_page_2_coursera.html#my%20id">click this visit top</a></article9><p></p>

        <p>A computer is a device that accepts &amp; information (in the form of digitalized data) &amp; and &gt; manipulates &gt; it for some &lt;result ©based on a program, software, or sequence of instructions on how the data is to be processed.
Complex computers include the means for storing data (including the program, which is also a form of data) for some necessary duration. A program may be invariable and built into the computer hardware (and called logic circuitry as it is on microprocessors) or different programs may be provided to the computer (loaded into its storage and then started by an administrator or user). Today's computers have both kinds of programming.
Major types of computers
<u>Analog computer</u> - represents data by measurable quantities 
<u>Desktop computer </u>- a personal computer that <br>fits on a desk and is often used for business or gaming
<u>Digital computer </u>- operates with numbers expressed as digits<br>
<u>Hybrid computer </u>- combines features of both analog and digital computers<br>
<u>Laptop (notebook)</u> - an easily transported computer that is smaller than a briefcase<br>
<strong>Mainframe (big iron) computer - a centralized computer used for </strong>large scale computing
<strong>Microcomputer - generally referred to as a PC (personal computer). Uses a single integrated </strong>semiconductor chip microprocessor.
<strong>Minicomputer - an antiquated term for a computer that is smaller than a mainframe and </strong>larger than a microcomputer 
<strong>Netbook - a smaller and less powerful version of a laptop</strong>
<strong>Personal computer (PC) - a digital computer designed to be used by one person at a time</strong>
<strong>Smartphone - a cellular telephone designed with an integrated computer</strong>
Supercomputer - a high performing computer that operates at extremely high speeds
Tablet computer (tablet PC) - a wireless personal computer with a touch screen
Workstation - equipment designed for a single user to complete a specialized technical/scientific task</p>
        <p1>A computer is a machine that accepts data as input, procesess that data using programs, and outputs the processed data. Many computers can store and retrieve information using hard drives. Computers can be connected together to form networks, allowing connected computers to communicate with each other.
The two principal characteristics of a computer are: <img src="file:///C:/Users/Pc/Desktop/html_css_new/computer.jpg" alt"there="" have="" some="" technical="" problem"=""> responds to a specific instruction set in a well-defined manner and it can execute a prerecorded list of instructions (a program). There are four main processing steps in a computer: inputting, storage, outputting and processing.
Modern computers can do billions of calculations per second. Computers do many different jobs where automation is useful. Some examples are controlling traffic lights, vehicle computers, security systems, washing machines and digital televisions.<br><article9> <a href="file:///C:/Users/Pc/Desktop/html_css_new/web_page_2_coursera.html#my%20id">click this visit top</a></article9><br><hr>

            Computers can be designed to do almost anything with information. Computers are used to control large and small machines which in the past were controlled by humans. Most people have used a personal computer in their home or at work. They are used for things such as listening to music, <br>reading the news and writing.
<em>Modern computers are electronic computer hardware. They do mathematical arithmetic very quickly but computers do not really "think". They only follow the instructions in their software programs. The software uses the hardware when the user gives it instructions, and gives useful output.
Humans control computers with user interfaces. Input devices include keyboards, computer mice, buttons, and touch screens. Some computers can also be controlled with voice commands, hand gestures or even brain signals through electrodes implanted in the brain or along nerves.
Computer programs are designed or written by computer programmers. A few programmers write programs in the computer's own language called machine code. Most programs are written using a programming language like C++, Java, </em>and Fortran. These programming languages are more like the language with which one talks and writes every day. The compiler translates <br>the user's instructions into binary code (machine code) that the computer will understand and do&nbsp;what&nbsp;is&nbsp;needed.</p1><br> <article9><a href="file:///C:/Users/Pc/Desktop/html_css_new/web_page_2_coursera.html#my%20id">click this visit top</a></article9><br>
